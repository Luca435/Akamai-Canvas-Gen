<h1>Akamai Canvas Gen</h1>

This is for Akamai Ver 1.7+. A Simple gen that gens the 1000 different Canvas (rCFP) values with rVal values which are needed for Sensor Data.

The Array gets logged in the console (F12 -> "Console").
Just clone or download the project and open the website (AkamaiCanavasSpoofer).
